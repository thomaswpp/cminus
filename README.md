# cminus
This is a CMinus compiler made with the Yacc (parsing tool) and the Flex (tokenization). This compiler translate the Cminus language, which is a simpilfication of the C language, to the machine code of my architecture, the ENIL Architecture. I had developed this just using C, and the Yacc and Flex tools.
